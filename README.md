# PHYS 1600/2600 Lecture materials
**Spring 2019**
___

All lecture materials and in-class workbooks will be stored in this repository. 

Please **fork** this repo to create a local copy on your [Jupyter Hub](https://phys1600.jupyter.brown.edu), local machine, or both (the last option is best). You should also **link your fork back to upstream** and periodically pull to make sure you have up-to-date lecture materials without loosing any of your own work. I will be adding additional lecture material throughout the course. 

Instructions for forking and syncing a repo can be found here:

and

These lecture materials are meant to supplement, not replace, in class lectures and readings.
